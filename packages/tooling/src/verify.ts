/**
 * The gate: what the pre-push hook runs, and what CI runs, in the same order.
 * CI is one job that calls this, so a green push means a green pipeline and
 * there is no second list to drift out of step with the first.
 *
 * Cheapest first, so the common failures cost seconds: a lockfile that needs a
 * dedupe or a file that needs a format is found before a minute of tests.
 * Turbo replays whatever this commit did not touch.
 *
 * `audit` is deliberately absent: its verdict changes with the advisory
 * database, not with this tree, so an overnight CVE would start failing every
 * push for code nobody changed. CI runs it in its own job, where that call
 * belongs.
 *
 * The docs site is excluded from `build` for a different reason: docs.yml
 * builds it at the base path rxova.org mounts it on, and that is the build
 * whose output ships. Rendering it again here, at a base nothing serves, would
 * add an Astro build to every push to prove nothing. `typecheck` and `test`
 * still cover it.
 *
 * CI runs these steps as separate parallel jobs rather than calling this script,
 * so a failure names itself instead of arriving as "verify failed" — the repo is
 * public and its Actions minutes are free, which is what pays for the split.
 * The lists are held together by `verify.test.ts`.
