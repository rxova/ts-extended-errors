//
// The `.md` routes exist so an agent can read these docs without parsing a
// Starlight page. Their failure mode is the reason this script exists: if a page
// starts using a construct src/lib/mdx-to-markdown.mjs does not handle, the
// build still succeeds and the `.md` still reads as a document — it just has
// `<TabItem label="npm">` sitting in the middle of it, or a link that resolves
// nowhere. Nothing else in the build would notice, and the reader who would is a
// model with no way to ask.
//
// So this asserts the things rendering cannot check: that every page has a twin,
// that no twin still contains unhandled markup, and that every link from one
// twin to another lands on a twin that exists.
//
// It reads `dist`, never `src/content`, because dist is what ships.
