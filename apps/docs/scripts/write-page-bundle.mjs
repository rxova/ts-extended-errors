// Marks the built dist as a page-component bundle for the rxova.org aggregator.

// Gate 1 of the ingest contract (rxova/rxova-website docs/INPUTS-CONTRACT.md):
// the aggregator never builds these docs, it downloads this dist and composes
// each rendered body into its own shell. The manifest is how it knows which
// project the artifact belongs to and what base path it was built for — a dist
// built at the wrong base is the one failure the receiver cannot detect by
// looking at the HTML.
