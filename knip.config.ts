 * Unused files, exports and dependencies, as a gate rather than a report.

 * The `export` keyword is the point: an export nothing imports still has to be
 * kept working, still shows up in completions, and still reads as part of the
 * contract. Nothing else in this repository notices one.
 *
 * Entry points are inferred from each package's manifest, so what follows is
 * only what inference cannot know.
