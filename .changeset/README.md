# Changesets

A pull request that changes `ts-extended-errors` adds one of these: run `pnpm changeset`, pick the
bump, and commit the file it writes. The summary becomes the changelog entry. CI checks for one; a
pull request that changes the package but publishes nothing (a dev dependency bump, say) is labelled
`skip-changeset` instead.

Once CI passes on `main`, the Release workflow gathers them into a `chore: version packages` pull
request. Merging that one publishes to npm.
